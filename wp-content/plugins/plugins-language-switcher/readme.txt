It changes WordPress back-end language according to user selection. 

== Description ==

Plugins Language Switcher allows to use different language (from WordPress default one) for WordPress back-end interface. It is useful for example if your blog front-end configured as Spanish but you or your editors and authors wish to work at WordPress back-end with other, possibly native language, e.g. English. Another variant of this plugin usage is other plugins translation testing without changing of the whole blog language WPLANG constant value.
This plugin shows in the language selection drop down list all languages which you have in blog wp-content/languages and wp-content/plugins directories.
It is possible to setup different back-end languages for different users. Plugin stores selected language value locally on user computer using cookies.
